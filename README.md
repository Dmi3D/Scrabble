# Assignment Two
This is our implementation of Scrabble. 

Points to note: 
1. We represented the board as a 15x15 2D character array that contains the tile letters (chars) in its cells.

2. We represented the multipliers of the square values of the board (e.g. triple word score) as constants. These constants
are being associated with their corresponding square using a 15x15 2D int array implementation.
