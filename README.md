# Assignment One
This is our implementation of Scrabble. 

Points to note: 
1. We represented the tiles and their values/scores as a hash map called tileValues. As such, this hashmap contains
keys of type Character(tile letters) and values(tile scores) of type Integer. All letters are represented in uppercase e.g. 'A', 'D',
and a BLANK tile in Scrabble is represented as a '*' character (asterisk) in our code.

2. We wrote the entire testing of Assignment One in the Main method of PlayerTest class. The class covers testing for all functionalities, 
with thorough run-through of every step taken, and output to the console. All that's needed is to run the jar file provided.
Please run the jar file in a full-screen CMD to retain the output format we desire for you to see.
